## Getting Started

### Installation

First, install all packages via npm.

```bash
npm i
```

You can then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Editing files

Most of the content is managed through [mdx files](https://mdxjs.com/) and these can be found in `/content/**/*`. Editing the markdown file will automatically update the content.

Pages that are not managed through mdx files can be edit in the `/pages` directory.

### Adding a new page

1. Create a `.mdx` file in the appropriate location (eg `/content/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/new-doc.mdx`)
2. Add your new page to the menu, this is not done automatically! See `/src/config/menus/*.ts` and add your new page to the appropriate file: docsMenu if it's a documentation page and apiMenu if it's a page that belongs to the API reference.
3. That's it!

## Credits

Website built with NextJS and Tailwind. We ❤️ the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) so we've used their layout and some of the components from their website. We've also used some components from [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/).
