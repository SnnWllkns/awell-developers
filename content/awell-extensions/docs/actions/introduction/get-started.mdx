## Prerequisites

**Before you can create your first Action Extension make sure you have the following prerequisites.**

1. You are familiar with the Awell Platform, care flow actions, and Awell Extensions.
2. You are familiar with **Typescript** and **React**.
3. You have familiarity with the **terminal**. You should know how to `cd` into a folder and run commands.
4. You have familiarity with **Github** and know how to contribute to an existing repository.
5. You have **Node.js installed**.
6. You have a text editor installed, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, or Vim. If you're not sure which editor to use, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Yarn

Note that we use yarn PnP which might require additional configuration in your IDE to work properly. If you are using VSCode, use the workspace configuration provided in `.vscode/` and everything will be ready to go.

If you use a different IDE, check the yarn documentation for instructions on IDE setup.
