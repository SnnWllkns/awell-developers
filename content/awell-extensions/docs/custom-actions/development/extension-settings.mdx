**Extension settings enables users to configure the extension when enabling it in Awell Studio.** Additionally, it is a way to securely manage secrets that you potentially need to run your extension (eg: an API key). Extension settings can be accessed by all Custom Actions in your extension.

## Setting fields

### Key

A unique key that identifies your setting. You will use this key to access the setting in your extension code. We recommend using a camelCase string.

### Label

A human-readable label for your setting. This is what will be showed to end-user in Awell Studio above the input.

### Description (optional)

A human-readable description of the setting. This is displayed as a sub-label underneath the label of the setting.

### Obfuscated

Whether the value entered by the user needs to be obfuscated or concealed. When set to `true`, the value entered by the user will be permanently hidden but the value can be overwritten if needed. Obfuscated settings are also encrypted before we store them to the database.

### Required (optional)

Whether the setting is required in order to enable the extension. The default value is `false`.

## Example

```typescript
// Define extension settings
const twilioSettings = {
  apiKey: {
    label: 'API Key',
    description: 'Enter your API key',
    key: 'apiKey',
    obfuscated: true, // set this to true when settings store sensitive data
    required: true,
  },
  fromNumber: {
    label: 'From number',
    description: 'The number we will send the text message from',
    key: 'fromNumber',
    obfuscated: false,
    required: true,
  },
} satisfies Record<string, Setting>

// Export extension with settings
const twilio: Extension = {
  ...,
  settings: twilioSettings,
}
```
