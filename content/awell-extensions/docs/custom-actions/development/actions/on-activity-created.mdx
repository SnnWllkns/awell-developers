title: onActivityCreated function
description: Define the logic of what needs to happen when your action is activated
---

The `onActivityCreated` function is called whenever orchestration or design (preview) activates a Custom Action. It will publish a message that is received by the extension server, which automatically finds the right Custom Action and calls the `onActivityCreated` function defined in that action.

**The `onActivityCreated` function has a couple of parameters that will be useful when developing an extension:**

1. Payload: not only allows you to access the values of your extension settings and action fields but also access patient related data.
2. Callbacks: `onComplete` and `onError`

```javascript
export const myAction = {
  ...,
  onActivityCreated: async (payload, onComplete, onError) => {
    // Do something here
  },
}
```

## Payload

The payload allows you to access the values of your extension settings and action fields but also allows access to patient data.

```javascript
export const myAction = {
  onActivityCreated: async (payload) => {
    const {
      patient, // access patient profile data for patient enrolled in pathway the activity is related to
      fields, // access the values of your action fields
      settings, // access the values of your extension settings
    } = payload

    // Do something
  },
}
```

## onComplete callback

The `onComplete` function should always be called in order to let Awell know that the activity can be completed.

```javascript
export const myAction = {
  onActivityCreated: async (payload, onComplete) => {
    const {
      patient, // access patient profile data for patient enrolled in pathway the activity is related to
      fields, // access the values of your action fields
      settings, // access the values of your extension settings
    } = payload

    // Do something

    // Notify Awell that activity can be completed.
    await onComplete()
  },
}
```

## onError callback

The `onError` callback can be called in order to let Awell know that you weren't able to complete the activity.

```javascript
export const myAction = {
  onActivityCreated: async (payload, onComplete, onError) => {
    const {
      patient, // access patient profile data for patient enrolled in pathway the activity is related to
      fields, // access the values of your action fields
      settings, // access the values of your extension settings
    } = payload

    try {
        // Do something
    } catch {
        // Let Awell know that you couldn't complete the activity
        await onError(...)
    }

    // Notify Awell that activity can be completed.
    await onComplete()
  },
}
```
