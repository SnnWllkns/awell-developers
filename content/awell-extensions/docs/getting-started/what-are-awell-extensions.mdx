Awell provides developers with an SDK/API allowing them to assemble their own piece of software to extend the capabilities of the Awell Platform.

### Custom Actions (beta)

Build, test, and deploy an extension to add Custom Actions to your care flows or reuse the off-the-shelf Custom Actions created by Awell and other customers.

Learn more about Custom Actions [here](/awell-extensions/docs/custom-actions/what-are-custom-actions).

### Webhooks (beta)

As an extension developer, you can write logic that gets activated by a webhook POST request. The extension generates a unique webhook endpoint which you can call from any system of your liking. You have full control about how to handle the incoming webhook and the actions that need to be performed in the Awell system.
