title: Get patient pending activities
description: Get pending activities for a given patient
---

This query allows us to fetch a specific user's pending pathway activities (i.e. activities that require them to take action) for all care flows/pathways they are included in. An activity is pending if its status is 'ACTIVE'.

The query has no inputs for the request body. However, we need to specify which patient's pending activities we want to see. We can pass this information in to the request in via the Header, using the `X-User-ID` key and a value corresponding to the patient id.

> We suggest reading the page on our [domain model](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/domain-model) first to get an understanding of the activity model.
