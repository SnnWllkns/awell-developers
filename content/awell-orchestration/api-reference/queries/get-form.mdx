description: Get the form definition of a given form

This query allows us to fetch the details and questions for a specific form and can be used to render the form and its questions in your UI.

## Evaluating display logic

Forms in Awell can have questions with display / visibility logic. Meaning that you can conditionally show/hide questions based on previous answers in the form. In order to render the form to the user and show the right questions, you have 2 options:

1. Implement the logic yourself to evaluate the display logic and show/hide questions based on the answers given in a form. You can find the display logic under the `rule` field.
2. Use the `evaluateFormRules` mutation and just send us the intermediary responses on the questions and we'll let you know what questions need to be shown/hidden. [Click here for more information on this mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/evaluate-form-rules).

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "id": "{{FORM_ID}}"

#### Where to find the form id

The id of the form can be found in the `object.id` field of an activity.

```json
{
  "activity": {
    "id": "{{ACTIVITY_ID}}",
    "object": {
      "id": "{{FORM_ID}}",
      "type": "form"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
