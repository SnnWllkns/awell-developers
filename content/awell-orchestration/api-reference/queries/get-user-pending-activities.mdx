title: Get a user's pending activities
description: Get all pending activities for a given user over all care flows
---

This query allows us to fetch a specific user's pending pathway activities (i.e. activities that require them to take action) **for all care flows/pathways they are involved in**. An activity is pending if its status is 'ACTIVE'.

**If you'd like to fetch the pending activities in a specific care flow / pathay**, use the [GetPathwayActivities query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-pathway-activities).

> We suggest reading the page on our [domain model](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/domain-model) first to get an understanding of the activity model.

## Request

### Headers

Use the `X-User-ID` header to specify for what user you'd like to fetch the pending activities for. Eg: you can pass the Awell patient ID as the value which will return all pending activities over all care flows the patient is included in.

We use the value of the `X-User-ID` header to find all activities where the value matches the `activity.indirect_object.id` field.

### Query

```graphql
query GetPatientPendingActivities {
  myPendingActivities {
    activities {
      stream_id
      id

      object {
        id

      }
    }
  }
}
