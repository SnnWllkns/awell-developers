description: Pathway elements help you construct a clear picture of where you are in the lifespan of a pathway
---

Where pathway activities represent every granular activity related to the operation or orchestration of a pathway, Elements are the building blocks of a pathway represented by their logical (e.g. this step belongs to a parent track) and chronological (e.g. this step's completion date depends on when all its child actions are completed) dependencies.

## Elements of a pathway

Elements allow us to reflect a pathway's overall shape. This means we can generate a clear picture of not just when we are (as with activities), but where we are in the lifespan of an orchestrated pathway. This makes them perfect for constructing [Gantt or Timeline-style views](#timeline-view) that give users high-level or granular views of a patient's progress through a care flow.

### Element types

**A pathway consists of the following types of elements:**

- Pathway
- Tracks
- Steps
- Actions
- Triggers (not yet supported in the query)

There is hierarchy to elements. An action's parent is a Step. A Step's parent is a Track. A Track's parent is a Pathway. In other words, `Pathway -> Track -> Step -> Action`. Pathways, being the largest unit of pathway definition themselves, do not have parents.

## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayElements($pathway_id: String!) {
  pathwayElements(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    elements {
      id
      parent_id # id of this element's parent. one of `pathway_id`, `track_id` or `step_id` from the context object below
      name
      status # one of 'active', 'done' or 'scheduled'
      type # one of 'pathway', 'track', 'step', 'action' or 'trigger'
      activity_type # one of 'api_call', 'calculation', 'checklist', 'form', 'message' or 'push_to_emr'
      start_date
      end_date # for a completed element, this is the completion date of the final action element in it
      stakeholders {
        id
        name
      }
      context {
        instance_id
        pathway_id
        track_id
        step_id
        action_id
      }
    }
  }
}
