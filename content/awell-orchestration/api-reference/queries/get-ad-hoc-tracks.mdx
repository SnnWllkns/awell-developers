title: Get Ad Hoc Tracks
description: Retrieve a list of ad hoc tracks that can be added to an active patient care flow
---

When designing a care flow, specific tracks can be set to be manually added to a care flow during Orchestration on as as-needed basis. These tracks can be activated at any time via an API call using the [StartAdHocTrack mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-ad-hoc-track). That said, you might want to retrieve these tracks to answer questions like:

- Which ad hoc tracks are available to activate for this specific patient care flow?
- Which ad hoc tracks are available to activate for published versions of this care flow?

**We provide a couple of queries to get the data you need related to ad hoc tracks.** Feel free to select the one that works best for your use case.

## Queries

### adHocTracksByPathway

Get published ad hoc track details by patient care flow (pathway) id, useful for identifying which ad hocs tracks you can start for a specific patient care flow. The `pathway_id` is the id of the patient care flow (pathway) that you want to add the ad hoc track to.

```graphql
query GetAdHocTracksByPathway($pathway_id: String!) {
  adHocTracksByPathway(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    tracks {
      id # track_id, used in StartTrack mutation
      title
      release_id
    }
  }
}
```

### adHocTracksByRelease

Get published ad hoc track details by patient care flow (pathway) id, useful for identifying which ad hocs tracks you can start for a published version of a care flow. Each published version of a care flow has a unique release_id, which can be found in any query that returns a care flow, its activities, or any of its components (forms, messaegs, etc.).

```graphql
query GetAdHocTracksByRelease($release_id: String!) {
  adHocTracksByRelease(release_id: $release_id) {
    tracks {
      id # track_id, used in StartTrack mutation
      title
      release_id
    }
  }
}
```

## Response

The response object shape is the same for both queries.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "adHocTracksByPathway": {
      "tracks": [
        {
          "id": "123456789012345678901234",
          "title": "Ad Hoc Track 1",
          "release_id": "123456789012345678901234"
        },
        {
          "id": "345678901234567890123456",
          "title": "Ad Hoc Track 2",
          "release_id": "123456789012345678901234"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
