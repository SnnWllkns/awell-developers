We have 2 environments you can interact with: **Sandbox** & **Production**. Our production environment is only available for customers with live implementations and is available across multiple geographies (currently EU and US, though we encourage you to discuss your specific requirements with us). The Sandbox environment can be used to explore, test, and develop your integrations.

An API key is needed for both environments in order to interact with our API. See the [Authorization](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/overview/authorization) section to get more information on how to authorize your API calls.
