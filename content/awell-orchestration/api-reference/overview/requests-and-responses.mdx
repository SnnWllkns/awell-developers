GraphQL API is an alternative to a traditional REST API, but operates in a similar way. To execute a query, make a POST request to the GraphQL endpoint (see [endpoints](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/overview/endpoints)).

## Requests

The GraphQL request body is composed of three parts. The GraphQL query document is embedded in the request as a string, under the field named `query`. Which query to execute is indicated by the optional `operationName` field. This field must be provided if the query document has multiple queries or mutations, to specify which query or mutation to execute. Finally, if the query defines any variables then include them as a map under the `variables` field.

Here's a simple request to execute a query which includes argument values for variables defined in the query. `GetPatient` is the optional (because there is only one query) `operationName` we have specified.

```json
{
    "query": "query GetPatient($patient_id: String!) {
        patient(id: $patient_id) {
            patient {
                id
                profile {
                    first_name
                    last_name
                }
            }
        }
    }",
    "variables": {
        "patient_id": "ExamplePatientId"
    }
}
```

### CURL

If you're sending a request via curl or HTTP, send the query with your API key in a JSON string.

```bash
curl  --location --request POST 'https://api.sandbox.awellhealth.com/orchestration/m2m/graphql' \
-H 'apiKey: YourApiKey' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "query": "query GetPatient($patient_id: String!) { patient(id: $patient_id) { patient { id profile { first_name last_name } } } }", "variables": { "patient_id": "ExamplePatientId" } }'
```

## Responses

The response is composed of a `data` section and an `error` section. The `data` section contains the response to the requests query. Any errors that occur during the execution of the request are included in the `error` section.

```graphql
query GetPatient($patient_id: String!) {
  patient(id: $patient_id) {
    code
    success
    error {
      code
      message
    }
    patient {
      id
      profile {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
