To interact with the Awell Orchestration API, you'll need an API key.

## How to get your API key

### Sandbox

Get in touch with us through the chat in the bottom right corner and we'll get you settled!

### Production

API keys to our production environment are only available for clients with live pathways.

## How to use the API key

Once you have an API key, simply provide add it to the header (`apiKey`) of your requests, as shown below.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>apiKey</td>
      <td>{`{{ YOUR_API_KEY }}`}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Machine to Machine (M2M) API

**The Orchestration API is a Machine to Machine (M2M) API** and uses a secret API key for authentication and authorization. All requests to the orchestration API should be sent from backend services that can safely and securely access the API key and add it in the relevant header without creating a risk of disclosing the API key.
