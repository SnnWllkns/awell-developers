title: Stop pathway
description: Stopping a pathway will stop the orchestration of the pathway
---

When a pathway is stopped, all scheduled steps will be cancelled and no notifications (eg reminders) will be sent anymore. The pathway will come to a halt at the state it's currently in.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StopPathway($input: StopPathwayInput!) {
  stopPathway(input: $input) {
    code
    success
  }
}
```

### Variables

We highly recommend to pass a reason for stopping the pathway as this creates transparency for why a pathway was stopped.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "reason": "{{REASON}}"
  }
}
```
