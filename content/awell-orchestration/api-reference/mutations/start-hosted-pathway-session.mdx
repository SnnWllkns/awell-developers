title: Start hosted pathway session
description: Start a pathway and create a session to redirect to the Awell Hosted Pathway page
---

This page documents the `startHostedPathwaySession` mutation but we recommend to read the [full guide](/awell-orchestration/docs/use-cases/hosted-pathway) on how to get started with Awell in less than a day via the Awell Hosted Pathway integration.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPathwaySession($input: StartHostedPathwaySessionInput!) {
  startHostedPathwaySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
    pathway_id
    patient_id
  }
}
```

### Required variables

`pathway_definition_id` specifies what pathway definition needs to be started.

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the patient should be redirected to when the pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 5]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

### Optional variables

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[6, 7]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html",
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "baseline_info": []
  }
}
`}
</code>
<br />

#### Patient id

Every pathway is linked to a patient resource in our system. We automatically create an anonymous patient resource if `patient_id` is left blank.

If you want to create a patient first, you will have to do an a priori API call to create the patient and use the id returned by that API call as the value for the `patient_id` field. See the [createPatient mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient) for more information on how to create a patient.

#### Baseline info

You have the ability to pass some initial data when starting a pathway. What data you can pass on pathway start needs to be configured in Awell Studio via the settings (see `Pathway > Settings > General`).

When your baseline data points are configured and your pathway is published, you can query the available baseline data points via the [publishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).

> There are `required` and `optional` baseline data points. A pathway will not be started until all required baseline data points have a value.

Passing baseline info is as easy as providing an array of objects in the following format

```json
{
  "baseline_info": [
    {
      "data_point_definition_id": "{{DATA_POINT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
      "value": "{{DATA_POINT_VALUE}}"
    }
  ]
}
```
