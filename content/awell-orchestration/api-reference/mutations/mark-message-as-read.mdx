description: Mark a message activity as read
---

This request allows us to update the status of the message activity to "DONE".

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation MarkMessageAsRead($input: MarkMessageAsReadInput!) {
  markMessageAsRead(input: $input) {
    activity {
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "activity_id": "{{MESSAGE_ACTIVITY_ID}}"
  }
}
```

### Specifying the user

The optional `X-User-ID` header can be used to specify which user has read the message. When this header is present, Awell Orchestration will log a subactivity indicating that this specific user read the message.

```json
{
  "X-User-ID": "{{USER_ID}}"
}
```
