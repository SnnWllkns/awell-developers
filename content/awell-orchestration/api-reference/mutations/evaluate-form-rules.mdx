title: Evaluate form rules
description: Evaluate what question needs to be shown next
---

This mutation evaluates all conditional logic defined in a form and lets you know which questions should be shown or hidden.

When working with forms that use conditional logic, you have to call this mutation every time a user answers any question in the form. This guarantees that you will always show the relevant questions only.

## How it works

<figure className="w-full flex flex-col justify-center text-center pt-4">
  <a
    href="https://swimlanes.io/u/g_uveCVSM"
    target="_blank"
    className="custom-link"
  >

      alt="Rendering a form with Awell"
      className="w-full sm:w-11/12 mx-auto rounded"
    />
  </a>
  <figcaption className="dark:text-slate-400 pt-1">

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation EvaluateFormRules($input: EvaluateFormRulesInput!) {
  evaluateFormRules(input: $input) {
    results {
      question_id
      satisfied
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "form_id": "{{FORM_ID}}",
    "answers": [
      {
        "question_id": "{{HEIGHT_QUESTION_ID}}",
        "value": "183"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Response

Important to note is that the response of this mutation returns an array of results stating what questions should be shown/hidden based on the configured display logic (=rules).

If a question is always visible because it has no display logic configured, then it won't be included in the response. **This means that, by default, questions not included in the response should be visible**.

### Example

- A form has 4 questions: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4
- Given the below response, we know that Q1, Q2, and Q3 should be shown and that Q4 needs to be hidden

```json
{
  "data": {
    "evaluateFormRules": {
      "results": [
        {
          "question_id": "Q3",
          "satisfied": true
        },
        {
          "question_id": "Q4",
          "satisfied": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Code snippet to get you going

```typescript
type QuestionRuleResult = {
  question_id: string
  satisfied: boolean
}

const isQuestionVisible = (
  questionId: string,
  evaluationResults: Array<QuestionRuleResult>
): boolean => {
  const questionEvaluationResult = evaluationResults.find(
    (result) => result.question_id === questionId
  )

  /**
   * If there's no evaluation result for our question (i.e. question has no display logic) --> show it by default
   * If there's an evaluation result for our question: see whether the display logic rule was satisfied
   */
  const isVisible = isNil(questionEvaluationResult)
    ? true
    : questionEvaluationResult.satisfied

  return isVisible
}
```
