title: Evaluate form rules
description: Evaluate what question needs to be shown next
---

This mutation evaluates all conditional logic defined in a form and lets you know which questions (that have display logic) should be visible or hidden.

When working with forms that use conditional logic, you have to call this mutation every time a user answers any question in the form. This guarantees that you will always show the relevant questions only.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation EvaluateFormRules($input: EvaluateFormRulesInput!) {
  evaluateFormRules(input: $input) {
    results {
      question_id
      satisfied
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "form_id": "{{FORM_ID}}",
    "answers": [
      {
        "question_id": "{{HEIGHT_QUESTION_ID}}",
        "value": "183"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Data format

Please note that all data submitted to the Awell API need to be strings (see `value` field above). You can use a simple function like below to make sure all answer values you post to our API are indeed strings.

```javascript
const ensureString = (val) =>
  typeof val === 'string' ? val : JSON.stringify(val)
```

## Response

Important to note is that the response of this mutation returns an array of results stating what questions should be visible or hidden based on the configured display logic (=rules).

If a question is always visible because it has no display logic configured, then it won't be included in the response. **This means that, by default, questions not included in the response should be visible**.

### Example

- A form has 4 questions: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4
- Q1 and Q2 don't have display logic defined
- Q3 and Q4 do have display logic defined

```json
{
  "data": {
    "evaluateFormRules": {
      "results": [
        {
          "question_id": "Q3",
          "satisfied": true
        },
        {
          "question_id": "Q4",
          "satisfied": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Given the above response**, we know that Q1, Q2, and Q3 should be visible and that Q4 needs to be hidden.

### Code snippet to get you going

```typescript
type QuestionRuleResult = {
  question_id: string
  satisfied: boolean
}

const isQuestionVisible = (
  questionId: string,
  evaluationResults: Array<QuestionRuleResult>
): boolean => {
  const questionEvaluationResult = evaluationResults.find(
    (result) => result.question_id === questionId
  )

  /**
   * If there's no evaluation result for our question (i.e. question has no display logic) --> show it by default
   * If there's an evaluation result for our question: see whether the display logic rule was satisfied
   */
  const isVisible = isNil(questionEvaluationResult)
    ? true
    : questionEvaluationResult.satisfied

  return isVisible
}
```
