title: Evaluate form rules
description: Evaluate what question needs to be shown next
---

This mutation evaluates all conditional logic defined in a form and lets you know which questions should be shown or hidden to the form assignee.

When working with forms that use conditional logic, it is recommended that you call this mutation every time a user answers any question in the form. This guarantees that you will always show the relevant questions only.
