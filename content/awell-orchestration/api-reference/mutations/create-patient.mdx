### Patient deduplication

In order to make sure you there's only one single reference to each unique patient, we advise you to first search whether the patient already exists ([see "searchPatient" queries](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/search-patient)).

### Establish a link between your patient resource and the Awell patient resource

In order to establish a link between the patient resource on your end and the patient resource in Awell, we advise you to store the identifier of the patient resource in your system in the `patient_code` field. This way its easy to establish a link between the patient record in your system and in Awell's system.
