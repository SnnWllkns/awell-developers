Continue reading if your goal is to set up longitudinal outcomes (such as PROMs / PREMs) collection, triage & eligibility flows and clinicial decision support with limited engineering effort.

## Integration

This integration enables you to orchestrate activities over time for multiple stakeholders on an Awell hosted activities page. The basic integration is the same as the one explained for the [Hosted pathway](/awell-orchestration/docs/integrations/hosted-pathway) integration. Additionally, this integration allows you to:

- Create a patient before starting a pathway
- Set up webhooks to be notified of pending activities, forms submitted or data points collected in active pathways
- Proactively request pending activities for a specific stakeholder at any time

Optionally, you can set up an integration with Elastic to access your data.

## Differences hosted pathway

- Timings: basically multiple "hosted pathways" throughout time
  - Client needs to know when sth new in pathway has been activated
- Multiple stakeholders

```js
careSession = Awell::Activity::Session.create({
  pathway_id: 'XYZ', // or activity id?
  activity_id: 'ABC', // if there are consequtive activities for the same stakeholder we don't want 2 sessions as that's not great UX
  stakeholder: 'patient',
  success_url: YOUR_DOMAIN + '/success.html',
  cancel_url: YOUR_DOMAIN + '/cancel.html',
})

browseTo(careSession.url)
```

Q: when does the session end?
A: when there are no pending activities anymore, pathway is completed, or manually cancelled

Q: will hosted activity be the same SPA as hosted pathway?
A: Yes, but probably different route
