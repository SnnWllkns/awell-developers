Continue reading if your goal is to set up an onboarding flow [see example](/awell-orchestration/examples/onboarding-pathway), collect forms such as intake forms, validated surveys, pre-consultation questionnaires or quickly set up a first integration with Awell Orchestration with minimal effort.

## Integration

Once your pathway is built and published, the only things you need to set up are:

- Start a new pathway through the orchestration API
- We'll provide you with a unique URL
- Redirect your user to the URL
- Your user completes the activities in the care pathway

When all activities are completed, your user will be redirected to the URL of your choice (provided in the start pathway API call).

## Sequence

Raw graphql --> SDK / npm package

Situation today:

1. Create patient
2. Start pathway

Ideal situation:

1. Start pathway which immediately allows passing patient information (optional) --> `createHostedPathwaySession` (Danijel + Mohsin)
2. Step 1 will return a url that you can browse to go get to the hosted pathway front-end (Danijel)
3. Hosted front-end (Kasia + Mohsin)
   - SPA (public repo on Github)
   - It needs a back-end
   - Activity per activity (https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/examples/onboarding-pathway)
   - Forms: question per question instead of whole form on the screen

Keep in mind:

- Authentication: we have session and they have a unique + random url.
  - Session automatically ends when pathway is completed
  - If pathway is not completed, by default we expire session after 15 minutes but timer
    gets reset after every completion of an activity
  - v2: configure custom session duration

Q:Does the session gets expired when user cancels the session?
A: Yes

Q:What if I want to create a session for a pathway that is already started?

- `startPathwayAndcreateHostedPathwaySession`: start pathway and immediately create session
- `createHostedPathwaySession`: start a session for a pathway that is already created (needs pathway id as an argument --> you pick up where you've left off)

```js
careSession = Awell::Pathway::Session.create({
  patient: [
    {
      name: 'Nick Hellemans',
    },
  ],
  success_url: YOUR_DOMAIN + '/success.html',
  cancel_url: YOUR_DOMAIN + '/cancel.html',
})

browseTo(careSession.url)
```

## FAQ

**What about the patient?**

You can start pathways for anonymous patients. Although you can choose to start a pathway for a known patient (see [Create patient](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient), this is not mandatory).

**What about branding?**

You have limited branding capabilities on hosted Pathway pages. For full control over your UI we recommend setting up a [Full integration](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/tutorials/get-started-with-awell).
