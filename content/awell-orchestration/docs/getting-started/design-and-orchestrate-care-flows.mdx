## High level

1. First, you'll need to design a care flow. We can provide you with template care flows so you don't have to start from scratch. Learn [how to design a basic care flow here](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/collections/3362788-tutorial-build-a-care-flow-basic) or click the Intercom button bottom right to request a template care flow from our customer success team.
2. Depending on your existing tech stack as well as the activities and the assigned stakeholders in your care flow, you'll need to set up an integration with our API or use one of our low-code user interfaces for patients and care team. [Request your API keys](/request-api-keys) to get started
3. After designing and validating your care flow, you need to publish it. This makes the care flow available for orchestration.
4. Next is enrolling a patient in a care flow, this depends on the set-up decided under point 2.
5. The activities to complete will now be surfaced in the relevant end-user facing applications.

## Guides

Discover our Guides including code samples so you can easily get started.

### Set up a patient onboarding flow with Awell Hosted Pathway

Awell Hosted Pathway is our low-code option to provide a user interface for the patient to complete activities such as filling in a form. It's ideal for a care flow that is initiated and completed in a single session, like an onboarding flow.

[Go to the guide](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/hosted-pathway-guide)

### Set up a multi-stakeholder care flow with Awell Hosted Activity

Do you have a care flow with interactions for other stakeholders than the patient or that spans multiple sessions (e.g. activities at day of discharge and activities at day +10 after discharge)?

Then Awell Hosted Activity is our low-code option to provide a user interface and handle the necessary orchestration to complete all activities for all stakeholders.
