title: Design and Orchestrate care flows
description: Learn the basic principles of designing and orchestrating care flows with Awell

Awell has built a platform that allows users to design and orchestrate care flows. These 2 domains, design and orchestrate, can also be seen as two distinct stages you have to go through in the lifecycle of a care flow:

1. You start with designing a care flow: create the blueprint of your care flow
2. You then orchestrate your care flow: enroll a patient in the blueprint you've created

There's a lot of similarities with building a house: you'll have first have to create a blueprint upon which you can then execute and build the actual physical house.

## Design

**Designing your care flows happens with Awell Studio**. This is where you will build, validate, and manage all of your care flows. Here you are basically building a blueprint or model of your care flow.

In order to build your care flows, we have developed a design and modelling language that allows you to structure and logically connect the different building blocks in your care flows.

### The building blocks: care flow anatomy

The design language we've developed consists of different building blocks, this can be considered the "anatomy" of a care flow. These building blocks can be hierarchicaly ordered as follows:

```text
Care flow
    Tracks
        Steps
            Actions
```

Tracks can be started based on events whereas within a track steps are logically connected with transitions. **The actions are the lowest level of building block we have and are also the actionable units in care flows** whereas tracks and steps are more used to create structure and the logical flow.

## Orchestrate

**Orchestrating care flows is the act of enrolling a patient into the care flow you have designed and published.** The orchestration domain is exposed by an API, the "Orchestration API" and this is the API can integrate against.

Whereas in the design domain you've built a theoretical model or blueprint of your care flow, when orchestrating care flows you'll be actually executing a care flow for patient against that model or blueprint.

**The Orchestration domain will therefore help you with answering the following questions:**

- For a given patient in a care flow, what are the current actions to complete?
- For a given patient in a care flow, what are the upcoming steps that will be activated?
- For a given patient in a care flow, what are the completed tracks, steps, and actions?

Additionally, you can also let the Orchestration API know that certain pieces of data were collected, actions were completed, etc. Which could be a trigger to go to the next step or activate a new track.

### "The State Machine"

In essence, the Orchestration domain can be seen as some kind of state machine. For every patient enrolled in a care flow you've designed it knows exactly what happened and what needs to happen by whom and when. You can feed data into the machine (eg: a patient submits a form) to let the Orchestration domain recompute what's next.
