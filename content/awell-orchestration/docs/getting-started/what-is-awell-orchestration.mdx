## What is Awell?

Awell is a low-code platform used by clinical and product teams to **design clinical workflows and integrate them into their tech stack**. With Awell, care organizations automate routine clinical tasks, synchronize data between systems and drive seamless coordination between care teams and patients.

### What is a care flow?

**Care flows go by many different names:** care plan, clinical workflow, care pathway, care journey, clinical protocol, patient onboarding flow, care program and many more. In principle, care flows are a sequence of activities performed by the care team and/or the patient to achieve or maintain a desired health state for that patient.

    <strong>care flows and pathways</strong> are used interchangeably.

## Anatomy of a care flow

Each **care flow** can have one or more **tracks**. These tracks are triggered by events happening in the care flow or in external systems. Inside tracks, the main building blocks are **steps** that you tie together using "if-this-then-that" logic. Inside steps, you define **actions** such as forms for data collection, messages to provide information, checklists to manage tasks and more.

These 4 levels (Care flow > Tracks > Steps > Actions) are the result of many iterations of the Awell Platform to come to a visual workflow modeling language that is fit for healthcare processes.

    Note that we have deviated on purpose from Business Process Modeling (BPM) language despite it being considered a standard process modeling language. The main reason is that healthcare processes are significantly different from regular business processes and they have several unique requirements that are not solved in BPM.

## The Awell Platform

Awell is a single application to design, validate, publish, orchestrate and continuously improve care flows. Awell has 3 fundamental pieces to it:

- **Design, Validate and Publish**: clinical operations, clinical experts, product managers, data engineers and others use our no code editor to design care flows using forms & questionnaires, messages, checklists, clinical notes, scoring algorithms and conditional logic to tie it all together.
- **Orchestrate**: after publishing a care flow, you start enrolling patients in that flow. From that point onwards, Awell orchestrates all activities for all stakeholders and systems.
- **Improve**: you have realtime access to all of the data generated by and collected in a care flow to generate insights on how your care flows can be improved from a clinical and operational perspective.

## Orchestrating care flows

This powerful concept deserves some more context.

After you publishing a care flow you start enrolling patients in it. From that point onwards, Awell takes care of orchestrating user activities and automation of the data flow between Awell and other systems.



After publishing a care flow, you start enrolling patients in that flow. From that point onwards, Awell orchestrates all activities for all stakeholders in the care flow in the back-end. To allow users to interact with these activities you can integrate with our API for full control over the end-user experience or leverage one of our low-code options to provide user interfaces to your patient and care team members. Orchestration also means automating data flow and integrations with 3d party systems like your EMR.

**Orchestrating care flows is the act of enrolling a patient into the care flow you have designed and published.** The orchestration domain is exposed by an API, the "Orchestration API" and this is the API can integrate against.

Whereas in the design domain you've built a theoretical model or blueprint of your care flow, when orchestrating care flows you'll be actually executing a care flow for patient against that model or blueprint.

**The Orchestration domain will therefore help you with answering the following questions:**

- For a given patient in a care flow, what are the current actions to complete?
- For a given patient in a care flow, what are the upcoming steps that will be activated?
- For a given patient in a care flow, what are the completed tracks, steps, and actions?

Additionally, you can also let the Orchestration API know that certain pieces of data were collected, actions were completed, etc. Which could be a trigger to go to the next step or activate a new track.

## Integrations

We strongly believe in an ecosystem of solutions (vs. a monolithic one-app-to-rule-them-all).

From your EMR or practice management software to your patient app, scheduling and medication delivery, Awell integrates with your existing tech stack. Check our [Webhooks](/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/webhooks/introduction) and [Healthcare interoperability](/awell-orchestration/docs/data/healthcare-interoperability) for more information or contact us to discuss your particular set-up.

## Next step

Our suggestion is to read the [Quickstart](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/design-and-orchestrate-care-flows) guide to understand the different stages in the lifecycle to design and orchestrate care flows with Awell.
