After [testing your webhook endpoint](/awell-orchestration/docs/webhooks/test-webhooks) via the pathway preview (test endpoint url), register the production endpoint via the pathway settings so Awell knows where to deliver events when Orchestrating your care pathway.

## Register production endpoints in the pathway settings

Awell needs to know where to send events. To register your webhook production endpoint, provide the publicly accessible HTTPS URL to your webhook endpoint, and select the type of events you want to receive on your endpoint. More information on how to configure webhooks can be found [here](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/6103339-configure-a-webhook).

### Webhook URL format

The URL format to register a webhook endpoint is:

```text
https://<your-website>/<your-webhook-endpoint>
```

For example, if your domain is https://mycompanysite.com and the route to your webhook endpoint is `/awell_webhooks`, specify `https://mycompanysite.com/awell_webhooks` as the endpoint URL.
