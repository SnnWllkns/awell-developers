title: Create dashboards with Awell
description: Use Awell's analytics tool, Kibana, for dashboarding & data visualization
---

This small tutorial will show you how to create data dashboards with [collected data](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/data/data-repository#collected-data) in Kibana.

Note: if you haven't used Kibana before, we can recommend to also read [Kibana introduction](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/data/kibana/introduction).

## Explore the data catalog

When starting to build data visualizations, the data catalog in the Awell platform is often a good place to start.

The data catalog lists all the data points that are collected in the lifecycle of a care flow and that can be used to create data visualizations. This means it is a useful resource to define which visualizations you can and would like to create (more info about the data catalog can be found [here](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4791428-data-catalog)).

In this example, we will look at the data catalog of the `Onboarding flow` template that is available in all accounts.

The onboarding care flow collects the PROMIS-10 patient reported outcomes through forms that then feed into the calculation of the PROMIS-10 score. Notice the data point keys associated with the different results of the score - they will be used later in this tutorial.

## Create population dashboard

Moving to Kibana, we can now create a dashboard that tracks the distribution of the physical and mental health T Scores for the PROMIS-10 calculation _across a population_.

Note: As mentioned on [Kibana introduction](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/data/kibana/introduction), you will only be able to create new dashboards in your dedicated Kibana space. The 'Care Flow Metrics' space is read-only.

**To create this dashboard we simply need to:**

1. Query the `orchestration-datapoint` dataview that contains all the [collected data](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/data/data-repository#collected-data).
2. Filter on the field `data_point_definition.qualified_key` to select only values collected for `promis_10.GLOBAL_PHYSICAL_HEALTH_T_SCORE` and `promis_10.GLOBAL_MENTAL_HEALTH_T_SCORE`.
3. Group by value to show the distribution of physical and mental health score across a population

## Create patient centric dashboard

Using Kibana, we can also create a dashboard that tracks the evoluation of the physical and mental health T Scores for _a specific patient_.

**To create this dashboard we simply need to:**

1. Query the `orchestration-datapoint` index that contains all the [collected data](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/data/data-repository#collected-data).
2. Filter on the field `data_point_definition.qualified_key` to select only values collected for `promis_10.GLOBAL_PHYSICAL_HEALTH_T_SCORE` and `promis_10.GLOBAL_MENTAL_HEALTH_T_SCORE`.
3. Filter on the `data_set_id` to restrict the results to a given care flow / patient.
4. Show the evaluation over time for the results
