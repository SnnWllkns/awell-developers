The data repository contains two different types of data: collected data and generated data. Collected data refers to any atomic piece of data collected from a user or system as configured in a care flow definition (form responses, calculation results etc.). Generated data refers to data generated by the orchestration of the care flow itself (generated steps, activities etc.).

## Collected data

All the collected data is stored in a single index: `orchestration-datapoint`.
