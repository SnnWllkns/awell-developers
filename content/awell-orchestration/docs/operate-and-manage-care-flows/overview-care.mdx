description: Learn how your clinical stakeholders can operate and manage orchestrated care flows
---

When your care flow is designed and published, **the time has come to start operating and managing your care flow**.

**Operating and managing your care flow means a couple of things:**

- You will start enrolling patients in your care flow
- Your clinical stakeholders will need an overview of all patients and care flows that are started
- Your clinical stakeholders will need visibility on what needs to be done by who
- Your clinical stakeholders will need to be able to interact with activities assigned to them
- Your clinical stakeholders will need to be able to have a look at individual care flows to understand where a given patient is and what actions are needed
- ...

Operating & managing care flows basically comes down to being able to run these care flows as part of your daily clinical operations.

## Options

### Awell Platform

Besides designing care flows, **the Awell Platform can also be used to operate and manage care flows**. [Learn more about operating & managing care flows with the Awell Platform.](/awell-orchestration/docs/operate-and-manage-care-flows/awell-platform-care)

### Build Your Own UI

If you want to keep your users in your own systems instead of using the Awell Platform and have full flexibility on the look and feel, then building your own UI on top of Awell's API is your best bet. [Learn more here](/awell-orchestration/docs/operate-and-manage-care-flows/build-your-own-ui-care).

### Integrations with EMRs/EHRs

Awell is currently talking to multiple EMRs/EHRs systems to discuss integrations. Unfortunately, today there are no integrations yet with EMRs/EHRs that enables you to operate and manage care flows from within those systems.
