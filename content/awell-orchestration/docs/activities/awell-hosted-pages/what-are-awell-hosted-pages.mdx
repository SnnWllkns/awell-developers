The Awell Hosted Pages app is a prebuilt app where stakeholders (patient and clinical stakeholders) can interact with activities in care flows. **It is the quickest way to get started with Awell.**

## Stripe analogy

When you are looking to implement payments into your application, chances are high you will consider using a platform like Stripe to collect payments from your users.

To collect a payment from a user, you will need to have some kind of payment page where the user can see the amount they need to pay and enter their payment details. You can do this by building a completly custom payment page on top of Stripe's API or you can leverage [Stripe's Prebuilt Checkout Page](https://stripe.com/en-gb-be/payments/checkout).

## Awell Hosted Pages

**The Awell Hosted Pages serve the same purpose as Stripe's Hosted Payment Page:** get you up and running quickly with the Awell platform. It is a prebuilt page created by the Awell team where you can redirect stakeholders to (or embed into your app) for them to interact with activities like:

- Reading a message
- Filling a form
- Completing a checklist

Awell Hosted Pages can be used for both patient and care team / clinical stakeholders.

When using Awell Hosted pages there is thus no need to build your own UI to let stakeholders interact with activities in a care flow which drastically decreases the effort to get started with Awell.

### Demo

Try it out yourself [here](https://orchestration-stories.vercel.app/stories/hosted-pathway).

## Branding

You can customize the look and feel of the Awell Hosted Pages. Via the tenant and/or care flow settings you can:

- Upload a logo
- Customize the page's accent color and page title

<Alert type="info" title="Setting a new accent color">
  <p>
    When you set a custom accent color, all UI components will automatically be
    rebranded based on that accent color. Awell will also automatically generate
    a secondary color and a text color with sufficient contrast which will be
    applied to the UI components.
  </p>
</Alert>

### Full customization

Do you want to have full control over the look and feel of Awell Hosted Pages **without any limitations**? We get that! And that is why the app with the business logic and the UI library are publicly available on Github. The app is built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and all UI components are written in [React](https://reactjs.org/). You can leverage these repositories to get a head start with your custom implementation.

## Benefits

**Using Awell Hosted Pages brings you a couple of benefits:**

1. We built it so you don't have to. It is the fastest way to get started with Awell.
2. It is optimised for any device to provide an optimal experience across mobile, tablet, and dekstop.
3. It is designed to be simple and to allow stakeholders to easily complete activities.
4. The page is available in multiple languages.
5. Customize branding settings to match the look and feel of your site.

## Use cases

**An integration with Awell Hosted Pages comes in 2 flavours**: Hosted Pathway and Hosted Activity.

### Hosted Pathway

The Hosted Pathway integration is ideal to quickly set up patient onboarding ([see example](https://orchestration-stories.vercel.app/stories/hosted-pathway)) or collect forms such as intake forms, PROMs/PREMs and pre-consultation questionnaires.

One engineer can set this integration up in less than a day. This makes it also ideal to test an end-to-end use case with Awell with minimal effort before considering other integration alternatives.

If your care flows/pathways are using scheduled steps to determine when activities are being activated or multiple stakeholders interacting in the same pathway, we recommend considering the Hosted Activity integration.

### Hosted Activity

Typical use cases supported by this integration are longitudinal outcomes (such as PROMs / PREMs) collection, triage & eligibility flows and clinicial decision support.

This integration is more powerful, allowing the use of webhooks and taking full advantage of what Awell Studio has to offer. It is a good way to get the most out of the Awell platform with limited engineering effort.
