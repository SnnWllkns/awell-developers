description: Use the Awell Platform to let clinical stakeholders interact with activities
---

Besides designing care flows, **the Awell Platform can also be used to operate and manage care flows and to let stakeholders interact with activities in care flows**.

When you choose to use the Awell Platform to operate and manage your care flows over building this yourself on top of Awell's API, it does also makes sense to use the Awell Platform to let your **clinical stakeholders** interact with activities in care flows.

## Views

When creating a system of work, there is no “one view to rule them all” as people in teams work in different ways, have different expectations and work styles. Some people prefer processes and timelines, others prefer task lists with due dates. And some people like to toggle all these views based on their objective - task management, long term planning, team coordination.

**When using the Awell Platform**, out-of-the-box you will have some powerful views at your disposal to operate and manage your patient population and care flows.

### Activity feed

The activity feed shows a detailed view of past, present, and future activities organised along a linear timeline.

### Timeline

**The Timeline view is the view that is able to provide the highest level overview on a patient's care flow.** It enables the care team to take a helicopter view, plan ahead, and look for overlaps.

### Interact with activities

You can click on an activity within the Timelinew view and activity feed which allows you to interact with the activity (eg: read a message, fill a form, submit a checklist).
