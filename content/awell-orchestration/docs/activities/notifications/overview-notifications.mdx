## When designing in Awell Studio

When designing your care flow in Awell Studio, you assign stakeholders to actions. These stakeholders are a-specific, e.g. action X needs to be completed by a "nurse", without specifying who the actual nurse will be. This is because when you're designing care flows you probably don't know by who exactly an action needs to be completed, only that it needs to be completed by a certain stakeholder.

## At run time

Opposite to design time in Awell Studio, during Orchestration of a pathway (i.e. at run time) you want to make sure the actions are completed by an actual human user representing that stakeholder in a patient's care flow.

It might be that a stakeholder is represented by one or multiple users:

<div className="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style={{ width: '100px' }}></th>
        <th>Design time (Awell Studio)</th>
        <th>Run time (Awell Orchestration)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Patient A</td>
        <td rowspan={3}>
          An activity needs to be completed by <u>a nurse</u>
        </td>
        <td>
          The activity needs to be completed by <u>Nick the nurse</u>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Patient B</td>
        <td>
          The activity needs to be completed by <u>Sanne the nurse</u> or{' '}
          <u>Nick the nurse</u>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Patient C</td>
        <td>
          The activity needs to be completed by <u>Ada the nurse</u>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Mapping users to stakeholders

In essence, you need to be able to map a human/user to a stakeholder in a pathway, e.g. once enrolled we know that for patient A, Sanne is the nurse. This means every time an activity is created for stakeholder "nurse", we can send a communication to Sanne so she can complete the activity in the care flow.

**The Awell platform does not take care of mapping users to stakeholders** so this is something that needs to be taken care of on your end.

Have a look at the subpages of this section to learn more about sending communications to different type of stakeholders.
