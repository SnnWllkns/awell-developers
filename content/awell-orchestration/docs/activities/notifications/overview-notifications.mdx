## When designing in Awell Studio

When designing your care flow in Awell Studio, you assign stakeholders to actions. These stakeholders are a-specific, e.g. action X needs to be completed by a "nurse", without specifying who the actual nurse will be. This is because when you're designing care flows you probably don't know by who exactly an action needs to be completed, only that it needs to be completed by a certain stakeholder.

## At run time

Opposite to design time in Awell Studio, during Orchestration of a pathway (i.e. at run time) you want to make sure the actions are completed by an actual human user representing that stakeholder in a patient's care flow.

It might be that a stakeholder is represented by one or multiple users:

<div className="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style={{ width: '100px' }}></th>
        <th>Design time (Awell Studio)</th>
        <th>Run time (Awell Orchestration)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Patient A</td>
        <td rowspan={3}>
          An activity needs to be completed by <u>a nurse</u>
        </td>
        <td>
          The activity needs to be completed by <u>Nick the nurse</u>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Patient B</td>
        <td>
          The activity needs to be completed by <u>Sanne the nurse</u> or{' '}
          <u>Nick the nurse</u>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Patient C</td>
        <td>
          The activity needs to be completed by <u>Ada the nurse</u>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Mapping users to stakeholders and sending notifications

**The Awell platform does not take care of mapping users to stakeholders** so this is something that needs to be taken care of on your end.

On creation of a user in your system, you assign one or more roles to that user. So in our example, Sanne, Nick and Ada will all be "nurses". This in itself is enough to generate views in your system that only show care flow activities assigned to nurses and will enable your team to collaborate on these activities. Taking this one step further, upon enrollment of a patient in a care flow you can assign an individual user to that patient, e.g. for Patient A, Nick is the assigned nurse. Each time Awell sends out a notification for patient A with recipient "nurse", you know that this is intended for Nick so he can complete the activity in the flow.

Have a look at the subpages of this section to learn more about sending communications to different type of stakeholders.
