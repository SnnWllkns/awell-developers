Continue reading if your goal is to set up an onboarding flow [see example](/awell-orchestration/examples/onboarding-pathway), collect forms such as intake forms, validated surveys, pre-consultation questionnaires or quickly set up a first integration with Awell Orchestration with minimal effort.

## Integration
Once your pathway is built and published, the only things you need to set up are:
- Start a new pathway through the orchestration API
- We'll provide you with a unique URL
- Redirect your user to the URL
- Your user completes the activities in the care pathway

When all activities are completed, your user will be redirected to the URL of your choice (provided in the start pathway API call).
