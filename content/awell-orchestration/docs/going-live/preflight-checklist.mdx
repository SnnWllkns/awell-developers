## Pathway

- Re-name your question keys to something consistent that is not verbose but captures the semantic meaning of the information collected.
- Validate your pathway with the preview by creating cases
- Make sure your pathway is published

## Integrations

### API call actions

- If using API call actions in your care flows, make sure they are configured for production

### Webhooks

- Configure the webhook endpoints across environments (see [testing webhooks](/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/webhooks/test-webhooks) and [go live](/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/webhooks/go-live))
