If you're using our Sandbox environment to test care flows & integrations then at one point you'd like to promote them to production to start enrolling patients in them.

## Sandbox vs. production

Our Sandbox & Production environment are completely separate environments. They have their own dedicated user management / authentication provider, data storage, deployments, etc.

**The Sandbox environment should only be used for testing & evaluation purposes**. No care flows with real patients should be orchestrated on Sandbox.

## Migration

There's no UI or feature in Awell Studio to migrate care flows from Sandbox to Production yourself. However, **we don't want you to manually rebuild your care flows** so our team has internal tooling to easily transfer your flows between environments. You can request care flow migration by clicking the button below.

### What will be migrated?

When you request a migration of your care flow from Sandbox to Production, we'll create a snapshot of the current state of your flow and move that to your production tenant. **Please note that your care flow history is not transferred**, but only a snapshot of the current state of your flow.

### Synchronization

**Given that Sandbox & Production are completely separate environments, there is no synchronization between environments.** If you have transferred a flow to production before but apply edits on sandbox, then you'll have to request a transfer again.

## Identifiers

You might have some integrations running on Sandbox that depend on identifiers, eg: pathway definition ids or data point ids. When care flows are migrated to production, these identifiers do change as well and you'll thus have to update any hardcoded identifier in your system.

Please note that there are some strategies to prevent hardcoding identifiers in your systems, which we described below.

<Alert type="info" title="Tip">
  You can use keys - which are user defined - instead of identifiers - which are
  auto-generated by the system - to identify identical data points between
  environments.
</Alert>

### Pathway definition id

The `pathway definition id` is a unique identifier for the pathway / care flow you have built in Awell Studio and is primarily used to indicate what care flow you'd like to start for a given patient (see [startPathway mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway)).

**To prevent hardcoding this identifier in your systems, you have the following options:**

1. If you're exposing a UI to your users: use the [getPublishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways) to dynamically load the published pathways in a dropdown ([see example story](https://orchestration-stories.vercel.app/stories/start-pathway)).
2. If you're not exposing a UI to your users: use the [getPublishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways) and do a search on pathway / care flow name to find the corresponding pathway definition id. This assumes the name of the care flow is identical between environments and does not change. It's probably a good idea to add some logging in case no care flow can be found.

### Data point definitions ids

Data points are atomic pieces of data collected in your care flow and every data point has a unique identifier. There are different categories of data points:

1. Baseline data points: data points that are expected when starting the care flow
2. Form data points: data points originating from forms you have created
3. System data points: these are data points that are automatically generated by Awell (eg: activation and completion date of a step)

**To prevent hardcoding these identifiers in your systems, you have the following options:**

1. [Use keys for baseline data points](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/6423139-enrich-your-care-flow-with-baseline-data) which you can query and find the corresponding id for via the [getPublishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).
2. [Configure and use question keys](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4815388-encode-questions-and-answer-options) for form data points.
