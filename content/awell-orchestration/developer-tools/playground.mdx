Open our GraphQL Playground to start writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries directly from the browser.

> Please note that the Playground is connected to our Sandbox environment. We don't offer a playground to interact with the production environment directly.

## Playground

### Authorization

**Before you're able to make API calls to our Orchestration API, you'll have to set your API key in the "Request headers" pane** which is located at the bottom of the Playground.

You can copy and paste the below snippet and replace `{{YOUR_API_KEY}}` with your API key.

```json
{
  "apiKey": "{{YOUR_API_KEY}}"
}
```

<p></p>

## Postman

Besides the in-browser Playground, you can also choose to use our Postman collection to interact with the API. Click the Postman button at the top of the page to download the Postman collection.

### Authorization

Go to the "Variables" tab of the collection and set your API key to start making API calls with the Postman collection.
