## Added

### New queries and mutations for Tracks

We now support the ability to add special tracks designated as Ad Hoc to a patient care flow at any time, so long as the care flow is active. These tracks can be configured in the same way as any other track, and can be used to manually add additional activities to a patient's care flow when the need arises. To support this new functionality, we have added new queries and mutations to the API.

The new queries are:

- [GetAdHocTracks](awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-ad-hoc-tracks)

The new mutations are:

- [StartAdHocTrack](awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-ad-hoc-track)
- [StopTrack](awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/stop-track)
