## Added

### Added `form` field to GetPathwayActivities query

It's now possible to additionally query for form content on form activities when fetching all activities for a care flow.

```graphql
query GetPathwayActivities($pathway_id: String!) {
  pathwayActivities(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    success
    activities {
      object {
        # previously you needed this id to get a form in a separate query
        id
        type
        name
      }
      # ...now you can just get the form here
      form {
        id
        title
        questions {
            id
            title
            dataPointValueType
            questionType
            options {
            id
            value
            label
            }
            rule {
                boolean_operator
                conditions {
                    id
                    reference
                    reference_key
                    operator
                    operand {
                    type
                    value
                    }
                }
            }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With this change, when fetching the activities of a pathway with the intention to display form content, you no longer need to make a separate query `GetForm` after. You can see the details of this query [here](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-pathway-activities).
