### PII

Some of our webhooks (might) contain Personally Identifying Information (PII) in their payload:

- **form.submitted** and **data_point.collected**: by default, we include the response of the form or data point in the payload of the webhook and depending on the data you collect, it might thus include PII.
- **activity.created** and **activity.completed**: the `indirect_object` field in the payload might contain PII information about the stakeholder the activity is assigned to.
- **reminder.created**: information about the recipient is included in the payload.

All other webhooks don't have PII in their payload but might contain UUIDs to identify a resource (eg: patient id and pathway id).
