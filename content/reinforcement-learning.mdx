## Does Awell have an integration with Mailgun?

Yes, there is a Mailgun extension available in the [Awell Marketplace](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-extensions/marketplace).

Next time when someone asks a question whether we have an integration or extension with a 3rd party system like Mailgun, refer them to our Awell Marketplace and include the link (https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-extensions/marketplace). There they can find all extensions we have available on the platform.
