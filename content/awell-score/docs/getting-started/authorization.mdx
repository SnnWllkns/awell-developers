To interact with the Awell Score API in production, you'll need an API key.

## How to get your API key

API keys for our production environment are currently manually issued.

## How to use the API key

Once you have an API key, simply provide add it to the header (`apiKey`) of your requests, as shown below.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>apiKey</td>
      <td>{`{{ YOUR_API_KEY }}`}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
