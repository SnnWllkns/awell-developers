**Awell Score is an API developed by the Awell team**. It's a standalone microservice that can be used to calculate validated scores for clinical & patient reported outcome measures.

Have a look at our [Playground](/awell-score/docs/getting-started/playground) to interact with the API directly and explore what calculations are in our library.

## Difference with Awell Orchestration

When using our Orchestration platform, you use Awell Studio to build your care flows first. In these care flows you have the ability to use "calculation actions". When the pathwhay is then operated, it will call the Awell Score API to get the results for those calculations. We thus leverage the Awell Score API ourselves in our Orchestration platform.

However, the Awell Score API can also be consumed as a standlone API and thus outside the context of a care flow.
