              This integration enables you to orchestrate activities over time
              for multiple stakeholders on an Awell Hosted Activity page.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This use case is perfect to set up longitudinal outcomes (such as
            PROMs / PREMs) collection, triage & eligibility flows and clinicial
            decision support with limited engineering effort.
          </p>

          <h2>Hosted activity lifecycle</h2>
          <p>The lifecycle for a hosted activity experience looks like this:</p>
          <ol className="no-pl">
            <li>
              At some point in time, a patient is created and included in a care
              pathway.
            </li>
            <li>
              When an activity is created (activated) in the pathway, your
              system will get notified via the <code>activity.created</code>{' '}
              webhook.
            </li>
            <li>
              At that point in time, you know something in the pathway needs to
              be completed by a given stakeholder. You can notifiy that
              stakeholder via the appropriate channels.
            </li>
            <li>
              The stakeholder reacts to the notification and wants to complete
              the activity. This is the trigger to create a Hosted Activity
              Session via the Awell API.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our API creates a Hosted Activity Session scoped for that
              stakeholder where you can redirect the stakeholder to in order to
              complete the pending activity.{' '}
              <strong>
                Note that a Hosted Activity Session is always scoped per
                stakeholder.
              </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              The stakeholder can complete the activity and we will let you know
              when the activity is completed via the{' '}
              <code>activity.completed</code> webhook.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This lifecycle is repeated for every activity that is created in a
            care pathway.

          <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
          <p>To get started, there are a couple of things you need:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              An <strong>API key</strong> to authorize requests to the Awell
              API. Click{' '}

                <a title="Get API key">here</a>
              </Link>{' '}
              to get your API key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link href="/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient">
                <a title="Create a patient">A patient resource created</a>
              </Link>{' '}
              and{' '}

              . It is not explicitly part of this guide but you can find
              documentation on creating a patient and starting a pathway on the
              respective links.
            </li>
            <li>Webhooks set up for your care pathway (see below).</li>
            <li>
              You have a server that can listen to incoming wehooks and perform
              an action based the events (eg: notifiy the stakeholder).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Webhooks</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Your pathway should minimally be subscribed to the{' '}
              <code>activity.created</code> webhook as that is the trigger to
              initiate a Hosted Activity session.
            </strong>{' '}
            Depending on the type of integration and events you want to receive,
            you can configure other wehooks as well ({' '}
            <Link href="/awell-orchestration/docs/integrations/webhooks">
              <a title="See list of all webhooks">See list of all webhooks</a>

            ).
          </p>
          <p>
            Webhooks are configured on a per pathway basis via the pathway
            settings so if you want to receive webhooks for events, you will
            have to configure them via the pathway settings.
